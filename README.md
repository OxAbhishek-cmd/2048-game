# 2048 Game in C

## Description
This repository contains a console-based implementation of the classic 2048 game in the C programming language. The game offers a challenging and fun experience where players need to strategically merge tiles to reach the elusive 2048 tile. 

## Key Features
1. **Game Logic and Scoring:** The game's core logic is built to allow tiles to move in four directions (up, down, left, and right) as players make their moves using 'w,' 's,' 'a,' and 'd' keys, respectively. When identical tiles collide during a move, they merge, and the player's score increases. The primary objective is to reach a tile with the value of 2048 while aiming for the highest possible score.

2. **Random Tile Generation:** New tiles with values of either 2 or 4 are randomly generated on the board after each player move. The placement of these tiles is designed to add a layer of unpredictability to the game and make it challenging.

3. **User-Friendly Interface:** The game features a user-friendly console interface that displays the current state of the board, including the values of all tiles and the player's score. It also provides a main menu with options to start the game, access rules, or quit, ensuring an intuitive user experience.

## How to Play
1. Start the game by selecting option 1 in the main menu.
2. Use 'w,' 's,' 'a,' and 'd' keys to move the tiles up, down, left, and right, respectively.
3. Merge identical tiles by moving them into each other.
4. Aim to reach the 2048 tile while maximizing your score.
5. Enjoy the game and challenge your strategic thinking!
